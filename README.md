#Rejected Talks

Ever had a talk you wrote and were ready to present somewhere only to have it rejected?  Well, we have too! Check them [out](http://rejectedtalks.github.io)!

##Add your own talks
To add your own talk to the list, just send us a pull request with the updated [talks.json](https://github.com/rejectedtalks/rejectedtalks.github.io/blob/master/data/talks.json) with your information and we'll merge it in!

###Requirements
* Talk should be complete. _Right now we only want talks that also have a fully baked slide deck.  Sometime soon we'll add a section to the site for rejected talk ideas_
* Talk should be hosted. _So that we don't take up lots of room in this repo and so that it doesn't look like we are taking ownership of these talks_

###Notes
* Talks can be on any subject
* Please tag your talks with a handful of relevant tags to make them easier to find

##History
This site came around when talking to @fourq at the 2014 Dreamforce about talks that people had done all the work to present only to have them rejected.  Out of this conversation came the idea to come up with a way for people to spread their talks to the world.
